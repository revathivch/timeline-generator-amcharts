# JavaScript Data Visualization: Build a Timeline Generator Workshop

Let's create a Timeline project with just JavaScript & Kintone Database together!

## ABOUT THIS EVENT

In this 2 hour workshop, you will walk away with a configurable timeline generator and the understanding of creating amChart graphs on a low-code database platform.

No need to know Node.js, AWS, or Vue.js. With Kintone, you can just focus on the front-end customization and not worry about setting up a complex back-end infrastructure either!

All you need is a basic understanding of JavaScript for this workshop!

## WORKSHOP OVERVIEW
